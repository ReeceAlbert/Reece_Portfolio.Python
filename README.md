# [Project 1: Spotify Data Machine Learning predictions](https://reecealbert.github.io/Reece_portfolio/)

This is a project that I did for my predictive modeling class in my master's program

* We were tasked with finding a dataset with more than 20,000 rows
* The task I wanted to solve was understanding the energy of a given song
* The dataset has 20 columns and 41099 rows
* Different machine learning algorithms were used to come to a conclusion
* Algorthims used: LinearRegression, DecisionTreeRegressor,Lasso,Ridge,RandomForestRegressor,KNeighborsRegressor,GradientBoostingRegressor,MLPRegressor
* This project was concluded on Monday April 17th 2023
