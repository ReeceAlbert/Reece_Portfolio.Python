# [Project 1: Spotify Data Machine Learning predictions](https://reecealbert.github.io/Reece_portfolio/)

This is a project that I did for my predictive modeling class in my master's program

* We were tasked with finding a dataset with more than 20,000 rows
* The task I wanted to solve was understanding the energy of a given song
* The dataset has 20 columns and 41099 rows
* Different machine learning algorithms were used to come to a conclusion
* Algorthims used: LinearRegression, DecisionTreeRegressor,Lasso,Ridge,RandomForestRegressor,KNeighborsRegressor,GradientBoostingRegressor,MLPRegressor
* This project was concluded on Monday April 17th 2023

# [Project 2: Tips Data Exploration](https://reecealbert.github.io/Reece_portfolio/)

This is a personal project. This project was used to help with my understanding of data exploration and analysis.
I wanted to see if I can explore the data and ask questions about it.

* The data was taken from kaggle [Tips Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jsphyg/tipping)
* The data had 244 rows and 7 columns

Question asked about the data after exploration
* What day provides the highest tips, lowest tips?
* Which time promotes the biggest party sizes?
* Which gender gives the most tips?
* Are more smokers geared towrds more tips, on what day?

# [Project 3: Sales Data EDA and Classification](https://reecealbert.github.io/Reece_portfolio)

This was a personal project. This project was geared towards understand sales data and find insightful items it in.
I tried to use some the tools I learned in my predictive modeling class and research I did online. 
I used different machine learning to classify certain classed inside the sales data.

# [Project 4: Diamond Pricing Data Analysis](https://reecealbert.github.io/Reece_portfolio)

This was a personal project with a dataset from kaggle.
Below are the simple questions I asked of the dataset:
Questions
1. Which cut has the price?
2. Which clarity has the avg highest price?
3. Which color has the highest price?
4. Which columns has the highest correlation?
5. What carats offers the best value?

# [Project 5: Multi-Class Prediction of Obesity Risk](https://reecealbert.github.io/Reece_portfolio)
Used a dataset from Kaggle that focused on Obesity Predictions in certain classes. This is part of a competition in Kaggle, where I can play around with data analysis and machine learning alogrithms tools. 
The goal of this competition was to use various factors to predict obesity risk in individuals, which is related to cardiovascular disease. Below I will show off my current analysis and the dataset. This project is still going.

# [Project 6: Space Titanic Classification Dataset](
Conducted Data Analysis and Machine Learning classification from a Space Titanic Dataset from Kaggle. The goal of the project to was to correctly classify which passengers were going to get transported or not.
